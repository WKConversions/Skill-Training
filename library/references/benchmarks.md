# Benchmarks

Curated breakdowns of work Karl admires. A growing set of these contributes more to taste than more
general rules, so this file is the place to add them: each new breakdown in the record format of
`references/reading-references.md`, with its kind (style, content or motion) and what to take and not
take. Add one only when Karl selects the reference.

## Motion benchmark: Addx Studio, "sends" product film

Karl's benchmark for how a film should move: youtube.com/watch?v=Ljr-lhLyuC0 (54 seconds, 1080p,
30 fps), a product film for the payments app "sends". What he likes is the animation and the way the
film is made: smooth, and constantly, purposefully moving. Stills don't show it.

**Measured** (per-frame change at 160×90, September 2026), against the first two intake-form videos:

| | Benchmark | WKConversions | K.B |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frames where something visibly moves | 97% | 65% | 87% |
| Share of the frame changing, typical frame | 3.2% | 0.2% | 0.4% |
| Longest still moment | 0.8 s | 1.6 s, plus a 3.3 s frozen end | 0.5 s |

It runs at 30 fps like our renders, so the smoothness is craft, not frame rate.

**What it does** (observed frame by frame):
- 0.3–1.1 s: a line of type builds word by word while an icon draws on; the line re-centers smoothly
  as words are added.
- 4.6–5.4 s: a whip zoom with motion blur out of one lockup; the brand name's letters rise in a
  stagger and the tracking tightens into the logo.
- 7.0–7.8 s: balance cards fly in from outside the frame with heavy motion blur, tilted in depth, while
  the headline builds word by word; a new element lands every 3 frames.
- 9.8–11.4 s: the camera pushes into a dashboard sitting on a tilted plane until an onboarding tooltip
  fills the frame.
- 17.0–17.8 s: a blurred cursor sweeps in and selects a pill; the choice darkens and scales slightly.
- 24.8–25.6 s: two wallet icons drift and rotate slightly during the hold, then whip out with blur while
  the next element arrives in the next frame.
- 36.0–37.6 s: avatars fly in blurred from outside the frame, drift, then all but one fade as the
  headline swaps "everyone" for "you".
- 45.2–47.6 s: during a hold on a card grid, the camera pushes about 5% and drifts; small
  illustrations inside keep animating.
- Throughout: interfaces at about twice real size (smallest readable text 36 px, headlines 65–80 px,
  hero numbers about 90 px), soft wide shadows, no crossfades, every scene change a morph, whip or
  camera move.

**Take:** the motion craft (`motion/animation-grammar.md`, `motion/camera.md`,
`motion/transitions.md`, `design/typography.md`) and the measurable targets
(`evaluation/quality-check.md`).
**Don't take:** its layouts, its dark-green palette, its bento grids, its payment-product visuals or its
copy.
