# Output format

After the art-director pass, the plan produces two documents: the **production plan**, the final
production instructions that the build follows and that an animator or another AI can reproduce
without guessing, and the **storyboard**, which Karl approves. Both come from one scene spec; the
storyboard is its condensed view, so the two never disagree. Detailed scene instructions are written
only after the planning steps, never straight from the script.

## Say what the user gets

Before building, say which route you are taking and what the result will be: an After Effects
project (`production/after-effects.md`), a Remotion build (an MP4 plus a project Karl can edit in
Remotion Studio; `production/remotion.md`), the plain coded render as a fallback (an MP4 only;
`production/coded-render.md`), or AE-ready instructions for someone else to animate.

## Project direction

At the top of both documents:

```
PURPOSE / AUDIENCE / FORMAT (aspect ratio, resolution, frame rate) / DURATION / CORE MESSAGE / TONE /
STYLE AND BRAND / ART DIRECTION (the visual world; mixed media decided once) / MOTION PERSONALITY /
TRANSITION FAMILY (two or three behaviors) / VOICE-OVER AND MUSIC (recorded, or timed at 2.5 words
per second; track or none)
```

## Scene spec

```
SCENE NUMBER:
TIMECODE:                   start–end in seconds; frames where it matters
VOICEOVER:                  the exact words
PURPOSE:                    beat type and importance, from the beat sheet
CORE MESSAGE:               what the viewer must understand
VISUAL STRATEGY:            from planning/visual-strategy.md
VISUAL CONCEPT:             the idea, in one or two sentences
COMPOSITION:                the settled styleframe: framing distance, alignment, placement, negative space
PRIMARY ELEMENT:            with its size at the output resolution
SECONDARY ELEMENTS:
BACKGROUND:
TYPOGRAPHY:                 the exact on-screen words, or "none"; face, weight, size
COLORS:                     color roles from the style and brand
MATERIALS:                  what the scene is made of: motion graphics, shapes, type, icons, UI, brand
                            assets, charts, photo, video, screenshot, generated image, texture
EXTERNAL ASSET REQUIREMENT: "None", or asset IDs with their requests
MOTION:                     cause → motion → consequence chains
EASING:                     named curves
CAMERA:                     move, amount, direction, depth
ENTRANCE:                   the start state, and how it comes out of the previous scene
IN-SCENE ANIMATION:         the relay of actions with timings in frames, and the working hold
EXIT:
TRANSITION TO NEXT SCENE:   the transition family, and what carries across
SOUND DESIGN OPPORTUNITY:
WHY THIS VISUAL WORKS:      one sentence, tied to the core message
```

The production plan adds **BUILD NOTES** (layer and precomp structure, expressions, or code notes) and
**QC NOTES** (what to check on the render) to each scene. Worked examples: `examples/scene-examples.md`.

## Precision

A production-level instruction states, where relevant: the element, initial state, final state,
start time, duration, position change, scale, rotation, opacity, blur, mask behavior, anchor point,
easing character, overlap, relationship to voice-over and audio, secondary action, and transition into
the next scene. Use approximate numbers where they make a scene reproducible (frames, seconds,
percentages, pixels at the known frame size, degrees, blur, opacity, scale, delay). Don't invent
meaningless precision: the values are starting points, tuned by eye.

Never write vague instructions such as "make it dynamic", "use smooth animation", "add a cool
transition", "make it pop" or "animate professionally". Specify observable behavior.

## Global consistency

End the production plan with the repeated motion rules, typography rules, transition rules, sound
rules, exceptions, and the QC targets (`evaluation/quality-check.md`).

## The storyboard page

One page. Per beat: a settled frame made with the build itself (rendered from the Remotion project
or the render page, or as a styleframe in the After Effects comp), so the frames Karl
approves are what gets animated; then the time, the voice-over line, the on-screen words, what is
shown, the motion, and the transition into the next beat. Then:
- **Notes:** suggested script changes (never silent rewrites), claims with nothing to show, and the
  assumptions you made (format, style mapping, which submission).
- **Revision log** from the art-director pass.
- **Asset requests** (`design/asset-strategy.md`) and **tool requests** (`production/tool-requests.md`),
  each also as a JSON block.
- **Open questions:** music, voice-over, anything unresolved.
- **Appendix:** the working tables (beat sheet, variety check, continuity table), collapsed.

Build it as an HTML page: publish it as a private artifact when the session can, otherwise send the
file. Once a render exists, put the film at the top of the page (a web encode published next to the
page as `film.mp4`), with the motion-check numbers beside it, and build the page from a small script
that fills in the frames and numbers, so every revision republishes the same page with fresh frames.
