# Scripts

Deterministic helpers for repeatable mechanical tasks; taste and art direction stay in the modules.
Fetch a script with the Artifact tool (`read`, the library URL, `path: "scripts/<name>"`) and copy the
saved file into the build folder.

| Script | What it does | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `render.html` | render-page skeleton: stage, camera, easing helpers, font loading | `production/coded-render.md` |

| `vo_align.py` | transcribes voice-over files and force-aligns the script for word timings | `planning/voice-over.md` |
| `qc.sh` | runs the five automatic checks on an encode (motion, shake, pops, busy, strips), results in one folder | `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `jitter_check.py` | finds shake: motion that moves in steps instead of gliding | `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `handoff_check.py` | finds pops: a place that changes in one frame (a blink, a jump in size, a layer appearing) | `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `strips.py` | strips of frames around every transition, or around given frames | `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `sfx_index.py` | measures sound effects from their waveforms (sync point, hits, decay, loudness, pitch) and draws them | `motion/sound.md` |
| `sfx_build.py` | trims and files Karl's sounds by role into `sound/sfx/`, writes the index and catalogue | `motion/sound.md` |
| `sfx_synth.py` | generates whooshes, risers, impacts, a stamp, a shimmer and a swell with exact sync points | `motion/sound.md` |
| `sound_mix.py` | mixes voice-over, music and effects from a cue sheet, each effect on its frame, to −15 LUFS | `motion/sound.md` |
| `music_find.py` | finds royalty-free tracks by mood and tempo and measures them | `motion/sound.md` |
| `music_fit.py` | cuts a found track to the film: a lift on the turn, its real ending on the end card | `motion/sound.md` |
| `music_make.py` | composes a bed to a brief: tempo, key, vibe and sections by bar | `motion/sound.md` |
| `brand_measure.py` | measures brand colours from images, checks frames against them (ΔE2000), computes contrast | `design/asset-strategy.md`, `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `film_tells.py` | reports a film's tells: invented figures and names, filler words, decorative labels, held against the facts file | `evaluation/tells.md` |
| `timeline.ts` | a film's timing as labels and relative placements (GSAP's position parameter), for Remotion | `production/remotion.md` |
| `phrase_check.py` | splits the aligned voice-over into phrases (the shot list), and measures on a render that every phrase brings a new visual | `planning/phrase-by-phrase.md`, `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `kinetic.tsx` | the kinetic kit for Remotion: word-by-word type with marks, rolls, masks out of objects, the breathing camera, keyed tracks; from Karl's references, typed prompts, a dial selector, a split exit, drawn strokes, blooms and flips; the approved speed graphs (`EASE`, `whip`, `popElastic`, `bounce`, `speedRamp`, `stepper`, `flick`, `zoomThrough`) | `production/remotion.md`, `planning/phrase-by-phrase.md` |
| `three_card.tsx` | a tested 3D scene for Remotion: a lit card with a soft shadow, frame-driven | `production/remotion.md` |
| `three_kit.tsx` | the 3D kit: a bright studio, a breathing camera, the logo as a real tile, a laptop, phone and panels with live interface screens (projected onto the 3D screens), frame-driven speed graphs | `design/three-d.md` |
| `stock.py` | searches royalty-free footage (Mixkit) and photos (Openverse, Pexels by ID), measures them, keeps credits | `design/asset-strategy.md` |

| `audio_look.py` | a sound file as a spectrogram over its loudness curve, with marks | `motion/sound.md` |
| `motion_probe.mjs` + `probe.tsx` + `motion_probe.py` | the motion probe: renders a Remotion film without pixels, logs every element's box and opacity per frame, and finds camera spikes, lurches, pops past size, flying and busy stretches; `--style calm/standard/energetic` | `evaluation/quality-check.md`, `motion/camera.md` |
| `mcp_call.py` | calls any configured MCP server's tools from the command line or a script (stdio and HTTP), with a device sign-in for servers that need one | `production/mcp-tools.md` |
| `busy_check.py` | counts the separate things on screen four times a second; busy when the median is above 6 or 8+ things fill more than 35% of the time (calibrated on Karl's references and K.B) | `evaluation/quality-check.md` |
| `ref_sound.py` | hears a reference's sound design: the music bed, the sound on each big move of the picture (against chance), the other effects; with the voice removed (Demucs) and the repeating music filtered out | `motion/sound.md` |
| `sfx_hear.py` | hears sound effects with an audio-language model: tone scales, style fit and what each sounds like, written into the index; `pick` ranks a role's sounds for a film's vibe | `motion/sound.md` |
| `map_make.py` + `maps.tsx` | the data and components for map animations: a dot map spreading from a place, country shapes with highlights, pins and routes | `design/maps.md` |
| `ae_read.py` | reads an After Effects project: every composition's keyframes, eases (with their Remotion equivalents), elastic expressions, text selectors, frame steps and hand-offs; `--sheet` draws the speed graphs | `motion/speed-graphs.md`, `production/after-effects.md` |

**Requirements.** Node with `playwright` and `sharp` in the build folder (tested with Playwright 1.56.0
against a pre-installed Chromium, and sharp 0.34.5); Python with Pillow, numpy and
opencv-python-headless.

**Also:** `stills.mjs` needs the Remotion project's own packages (run it from the project folder);
`vo_align.py` needs `pip install pocketsphinx` and ffmpeg; the sound scripts need ffmpeg, numpy, Pillow
and `pip install pyloudnorm`, and `sound_mix.py` reads the library's `sound/` folder.

**Usage.**
- `node render.mjs test 0,45,120` renders those frames to `test/` as PNG; `node render.mjs full 0 899 4 8`
  renders every frame to `frames/` as JPEG, with 4 parallel pages and 8 motion-blur samples (1 turns
  blur off). `PAGE` sets the page (default `render.html`), `SIZE` the frame (default `1080x1920`).
- `python3 contact_sheet.py` reads `test/f*.png` and writes `test/sheet.png`, 8 columns 216 px wide.
- `bash qc.sh film.mp4 qc/` runs motion, shake, pop and strip checks; read `qc/shake.txt`,
  `qc/pops.txt` and look at `qc/pops/*.png` and `qc/strips/sheet_*.png`. About 4 minutes for 45 seconds.
- `python3 jitter_check.py film.mp4 --png worst.png`: `SHAKE` lines are errors (regular steps, or many
  places at once); `look` lines are small irregular jumps to check in a strip. Exit code 1 on a shake.
- `python3 handoff_check.py film.mp4 --strips pops/ [--cuts 120,452]`: every `POP` comes with a strip,
  cropped to where it happened; designed hard cuts go in `--cuts`. Exit code 1 on a pop.
- `python3 strips.py film.mp4 strips/ [--at 140,146]`: without `--at` it finds the transitions itself.
- `python3 motion_check.py out.mp4 --profile` prints the three motion numbers (the last 2 seconds are
  ignored on films longer than 4 seconds) and, with `--profile`, one line per second.
- `bash render_chunks.sh Film out/final.mp4 '{"blurSamples":8}' 0,252,600,870,1110 public/audio/mix.wav`
  from the project folder: the boundaries are each chunk's first frame, then the total.
- `python3 sound_mix.py sound/cues.json public/audio/mix.wav --sheet mix.png [--music other.wav]`: cue
  format in the script's header; prints the level report (effects masked by the bed, effects crowding
  the voice) and the final loudness. About 10 seconds.
- `python3 music_find.py --mood calm,hopeful --feel calming,bright --bpm 85-115 --min 40 --out music/`
  downloads and measures candidates; read `music/candidates.png`.
- `python3 music_fit.py track.mp3 bed.wav --length 37 --lift 9.0 --sheet fit.png` prints the plan (the
  tempo, the start, the join, where each entry and the last chord land in the film).
- `python3 music_make.py brief.json bed.wav`: the brief format is in the script's header.
- `python3 audio_look.py mix.wav look.png --marks 9.0,25.0`.
- `python3 sfx_index.py <folder> waves/` measures every sound and draws the waveform sheets; then
  `sfx_build.py <folder> <library/sound>` and `sfx_synth.py <library/sound>`.
- `python3 brand_measure.py measure site.png logo.png --out brand.json`, then
  `python3 brand_measure.py verify out/test/f*.png --brand brand.json` and
  `python3 brand_measure.py contrast "#121212/#F6F4F1" "#FFFFFF/#BD1717"`. In brand.json, `palette`
  holds measured colours, `tokens` the film's colour tokens (name: hex), `accent` the brand's accent.
- `python3 phrase_check.py plan src/words.json` lists the phrases with their times (one visual each);
  `python3 phrase_check.py check out/draft.mp4 src/words.json --sheet phrases.png` flags STATIC phrases
  and the longest voice without a new visual; exit code 1 while any fail.
- `python3 film_tells.py films/<project>`: reads `harvest/facts.md` and `storyboard/thesis.md` when
  they exist; exit code 1 while tells are unanswered.
- `python3 stock.py search "tourist phone street" --kind video --out stock/`, then
  `python3 stock.py get stock/candidates.json 3,7 --to public/footage`; read `stock/candidates.png`.
- `reference_frames.js`: run it in the video's page, then `await sheet([0.5, 2, 3.5])` and screenshot the
  canvas.
- `site_extract.js`: run it in the client's page after scrolling once; it returns one object.
- `grab.js`: define it once in the page, then `await grab(url)` returns a data URL; the part after the
  comma is the file in base64.

Good candidates for future scripts: validating brief fields, converting timecodes between frame
rates, building a scene timing sheet from word timings, exporting reference thumbnails.
