# Phrase by phrase

Karl's standing direction, given on every film since October 2026: the visuals show what is being said,
as it is said. More frames, more animation, never a presentation, and always think outside the box for
the ways to explain and the ways to move between ideas. A voice-over talking over a page that holds
still is the one result he rejects every time. This module is how to plan for that, and how to prove it.

## What makes a film a presentation

A film reads as a presentation when a layout holds while the voice explains it: a title and some bullets
or cards build in place, beat after beat, and the beats are joined by pushes or fades. Its symptoms:
- one storyboard frame per beat, because nothing in a beat changes enough to need a second;
- the same page on screen for more than about 2.5 seconds of voice;
- type that repeats the voice-over instead of a picture that explains it;
- every scene change is a cut, fade or push between pages;
- each beat built and torn down on its own, nothing carried from one to the next.

Measured on the Bruno Morgante film that Karl called a presentation (v2): 8 of its 29 phrases brought
nothing new on screen, and 3.4 seconds of voice played over a held page. The rebuild (v3), on the same
script: 30 of 31 phrases, and never more than 1.0 second.

## The rule

- **One continuous stage, not a set of scenes.** Build one world in which objects persist and transform:
  the viewer's project card that tangles and becomes the portfolio's first row, the client's figure that
  goes from tangled signal to their mirrored pattern, the logo that becomes a map pin. Beats are states
  of that world, not pages; nothing is built for one beat and thrown away.
- **The phrase is the unit, not the sentence or the beat.** Split the force-aligned voice-over into
  phrases (`scripts/phrase_check.py plan words.json`). Every phrase gets its own visual event on the
  word that carries it: something arrives, changes state, transforms, is marked, or the camera reveals
  it. A 30-second script has 20 to 30 phrases; the film has as many visual ideas.
- **A thread, and still a new idea per beat.** Choose one object from the client's own world to carry
  the film (their logo's geometry, their hero diagram, the viewer's own project) and let it change with
  the story, set up early and paid off at the end. The thread is the stage, not the answer: each beat
  still gets its own strategy (`examples/corrections.md`: one device can't answer every line).
- **Show it, then name it.** The picture explains; the type labels it. On-screen words are the key
  phrase only (six words or fewer to a line), built word by word on the spoken words, and the key word
  does something: a mark sweeps under it, it is struck out, ringed, underlined, rolls into another
  word, or changes colour. Unmarked lines of type that only repeat the voice are subtitles.
- **No dead voice.** Never more than 2.5 seconds of voice without a new visual. A working hold
  (the camera pushing, something drifting) keeps the frame alive, but it isn't a new visual.
- **Calm is not static.** A brief that asks for calm pacing and no busy animation (Amargier Advisory)
  gets one move at a time, slower curves and more white space, and still a new visual on every phrase.

## Thinking outside the box: where the idea comes from

For each phrase, run the list and take the idea that reads in a second with the sound off and grows
out of the previous frame. Then cut anything that doesn't read.

1. **Make the word the object.** "idea." gets a mark and the mark becomes the project card; "why" brings
   the tangle; "stick." gets a mark that floods the frame and becomes the next scene.
2. **Act out the verb.** Tangle and untangle, scan and order, connect, link, lay brick by brick, rise,
   open on a centre line, fold away, strike off, fall away, gather in.
3. **Make the quantity physical.** 200 dots for 200 people mentored; twelve ticks for twelve years,
   which then lay the logo; a counter that rolls like an odometer instead of a number that swaps.
4. **Rebuild the client's own forms, live.** Their hero diagram, their logo geometry (traced into vectors
   so it can move), their insight cards, their numbered steps, their example profile. They are the
   brand's own visual language, and they explain the product truthfully.
5. **Turn space into meaning.** A map that spreads out from their home city; a hub with an orbit of
   partners; an axis from strategy to execution with stops lit as they are named; mirror symmetry for a
   product called a mirror; a range slider from executives to students.
6. **Before and after on the same objects.** Dashed links turn solid; statuses roll from Blocked to On
   track; tangled lines order into a pattern; the Idea pill rolls into Result. Swapping in new objects
   loses the change.
7. **The callback.** The opening object returns at the end, changed: the idea card comes back as a
   result; the logo's two bars return as "the thinking" and "the doing"; the bars that met as partners
   close the film as the mark.
8. **People where the line is about people.** The founder's photo at the centre of the ecosystem on
   "hands-on leadership"; labels struck off a person on "not another label".
10. **Borrow a technique that acts it out.** `references/technique-catalogue.md` lists twenty from Karl's
   reference films, with their timing: a dial that rolls to the number, a typed prompt with products
   inside the sentence, the word that is a button, a lens that reveals, rings whose label changes with
   each feature.
11. **Marking as punctuation.** One mark per phrase at most, in the brand's accent: a marker sweep, an
   underline, a strike, a hand-drawn ring.

## Transitions grow out of objects

Every transition names the object it grows out of; if you can't name it, it is a page change. The ones
that worked in Karl's films (`motion/transitions.md` has the families):
- **A mask out of an object:** a colour field or the next scene grows as a circle out of the card, the
  person, the map pin, the apex of the logo, the button.
- **The mark becomes the next thing:** the highlight under a word becomes a card; the mark under
  "stick." floods the frame red for the numbers; the logo lands as a map pin.
- **Layout transformation:** the tangled cards line up into a ranked portfolio; four insight cards
  gather into one assessment; the businesses on a map fly into an ecosystem ring.
- **Something opens or closes:** a card opens on its centre line into the next screen; the hub folds into
  its centre; two hundred dots gather into the one person who said the quote.
- **A line leads:** a scan line orders what it passes; a red line rises like a curtain onto a stage.
- **A word becomes another word:** a roll in one slot ("hard lessons" into "stories").
- **The camera** pushes slowly through every beat and is released on each transition, so it never locks
  and never jumps (`motion/camera.md`).

Keep two or three of these families for a film, and never a crossfade between layouts.

## Colour fields change with the story

Change the background with the story, through masks that grow out of objects, so the colour change is
itself a move: white, the brand's warm white, a pale tint of its accent, one full field of the accent for
the moment that matters. Bright by default; Karl: no static, standard dark background.

## The storyboard shows the phrases

A frame per phrase, at least three per beat, each with its time and what moves: 30 to 40 frames for a
film of 30 to 45 seconds (`production/output-format.md`). A storyboard with one frame per beat is a
presentation storyboard, whatever the film turns out to be.

## Measure it

On the draft and on the final encode: `python3 scripts/phrase_check.py check film.mp4 src/words.json
--sheet phrases.png`. Every phrase brings a new visual (6% of the frame changed, or 0.6% of it new
structure, after camera moves are aligned out), and no more than 2.5 seconds of voice passes without
one. Read the sheet: a phrase flagged STATIC is a phrase the picture doesn't explain yet. Calibration on
Karl's films:

| Bruno Morgante v3 | 30 of 31 | 1.0 s |
| MindMirror | 21 of 21 | 0.0 s |
